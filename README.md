# facebook-messenger-chatbot
A Facebook Messenger chatbot built using the Chatfuel platform that integrates with Apigee and Okta to automate table bookings at a restaurant!

This project integrates a Facebook Messenger chatbot with Okta to demonstrate the  capabilities of Okta's CIAM solution. It uses a platform called Chatfuel to integrate Facebook Messenger with Okta's APIs. The chatbot, built with a fictitious restaurant in mind authenticates end-users and performs account linking of a user's Facebook account with their account at the restaurant's web-site that is managed by Okta. The chatbot then engages in a personalised conversation with the end-user based on the user's preferences stored in Okta to present tailored menu options to the end-user and finally secures a table booking at the restaurant after presenting a 2-factor challenge to the user to confirm the reservation. This prototype demonstrates several capabilities of the Okta CIAM platform such as authentication, account linking, maintaining a central user profile in Okta's cloud user store to provide a 360 degree view of users and step up Multi-factor authentication. It brings these capabilities together using a user friendly chat interface integrated with Facebook Messenger to bring home the value that Okta's Customer Identity products can provide to businesses in today's age of personalisation and digitisation
